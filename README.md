beaconsync
==========

Beaconsync is a WordPress plugin for relating posts to Bluetooth Low Energy beacons, and
syncing the beacon, URL, and other post information to devices.

== Description ==

Beaconsync makes it easy to link up WordPress content with a mobile app that detects
Bluetooth Low Energy beacons.

The UUID, major, and minor information can be set on each post by the author. A mobile
app may sync with a given WordPress site to get a list of beacons known to the site, as well
as retrieve standard information about the post(s) that correspond to each beacon, through
the site's existing Atom/RSS2 feeds.

== History ==

This plugin originated from a volunteer effort for Discovery Center of Idaho 
(http://www.dcidaho.org) to help simplify exhibit signage, and add to the depth of
information available at each exhibit, by providing more content delivered automatically
on mobile devices as guests approach each exhibit.
