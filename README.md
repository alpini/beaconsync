Beaconsync is a WordPress plugin for relating posts to Bluetooth Low Energy beacons, and
syncing the beacon, URL, and other post information to devices.

Description
---
Beaconsync makes it easy to link up WordPress content with a mobile app that detects
Bluetooth Low Energy beacons.

A beacon UUID, major, and minor codes may be set on each post by the author during creation
of the post, or after the fact.

A mobile app may sync with a given WordPress site to get a list of beacons known to the site,
as well as retrieve information about the post(s) that correspond to each beacon, through
the site's existing Atom/RSS2 feeds.

History

This plugin came about as part of a volunteer effort for Discovery Center of Idaho
(http://www.dcidaho.org) to simplify exhibit signage and add to the depth of information
available at each exhibit using "iBeacons.""
